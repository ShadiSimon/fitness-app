# asssessment_2
A new Flutter project. in figma, i got messed up.I was not clear about recuirement.In figma, i made all of four projects in(coffee shop, car parking, gymnastics, service desk).I didn't get good comments and my thought wasn't deep. Now, in flutter i decided to work on one project to make it better.

this is a parking order app that lets the user choose from lists of parking spots and pay


please just add the lib folder into a new project with flutter. mine does not work no matter how hard i try


final edit. i fixed it. but it is in a different repository because i redownloaded the entire thing on a different device
